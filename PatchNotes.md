# Leveling Guide - Patch Notes

### Metamorph League

* Added the ability to track your desired gem links while leveling (Alt+g)
** Automatically updates with your level
* Added the ability to set the folder you want to read your notes from
** This allows you to have multiple different builds in different folders and just select the folder in the config file
* Removed Map names since they can be different teirs in Metamorph, now you just select a tier for level information
** Still no support for Map notes, but I'm not sure if I will leave maps in next league, it depends on how Conquer's feels

### Blight League

* Added Passive Tree overlay
* Allowed per Zone notes
* Added Crafting Recipes to notes
* Now auto hides the overlay after a configurable time (can be disabled)
* Now tracks level and experience automatically
* Calculates how many levels over the optimal level you are for a given zone
* Added 3.8 Maps and tiers for calculating experience during mapping (notes disabled for now)

#### Minor improvements

* Added non-mandatory zones
* Improved word wrapping
* Exp starts hidden with everything else
* The skill tree can now be a png file
* Moved skill tree hotkey to Alt+f so it is closer to the left hand
* Improved tree sizing

### Legion League

* Takes zone layout images and displays them on top of the screen
* Shows leveling notes on GEMs to take and Passives to pick up
* Allows manual notes per Act
* Automatically switches zones

#### Bugs

* Fixed a bug where the application was stealling focus making it hard to Cyclone
* Fixed a bug where the overlay would show up for any dialogue and not just zone changes
* Fixed a bug where the Note width was being used for the Guide width
