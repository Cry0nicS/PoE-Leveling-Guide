Common tips for FAST leveling:
- Try to no TP to Town at all (saves time and scrolls).
--- this guide will tell you when it is really needed
- Each time you're in town, take rewards and check what vendors sells
- While in Act1, look vendors for boots with + speed
--- type "nn" in filter to find them
--- in Act 2 if still don't have them, just bench craft it
- Always make spells "attack without moving"
- Try to be 1-3 lvl below the zone level
--- do not try to kill all mobs in a zone
- Untill ~Blood Aqueduct (Act 8) don't pay attantion to drop from mobs
--- except rings/currency/items with needed links
--- keep in mind which links/currency you will need later
- Don't use body armor, it slows your character a bit
