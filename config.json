points:		This is the font size
		I highly recommend leaving this at 9 as the GUI gets too big
		However on large screens you could increase it slightly
		Note that the pictures are hardcode and will not change size

maxNotesWidth:	How many characters should be shown before wrapping text
		The longer this is the larger the Notes GUI will be

offset:		How much space to leave on the right side of the screen
		1 = All the way to right (covers the map/info)
		This is a good setting if you're going to Alt+F2 and hide the notes
		.85 = As far right as you can go without covering the Mini-Map
		Great setting if you don't use the overlay map
		.8 = Default setting, as far as you can go without covering anything
		This setting basically centers the UI but covers a lot of screen

treeSide:	Which side of the screen to show the passive tree overlay
		The default is the left so it does not interfere with the Inventory
		However, I prefer it on the right and I assume others may as well

opacity:	Lower this number to see through the images and notes more
		200 makes the text crisp but can be hard to see through
		150 is still readable but some backgrounds make it hard

startHidden:	Should the overlay display on startup
		By default it will so new users see that it is working
		However if you would like it just as a reference you can change this value to 1
