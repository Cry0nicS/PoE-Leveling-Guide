maxNotesLenght:	How many characters should be shown before wrapping text
		The longer this is the larger the Notes GUI will be

offset:		How much space to leave on the right side of the screen
		1 = All the way to right (covers the map/info)
		This is a good setting if you're going to Alt+F2 and hide the notes
		.85 = As far right as you can go without covering the Mini-Map
		Great setting if you don't use the overlay map
		.8 = Default setting, as far as you can go without covering anything
		This setting basically centers the UI but covers a lot of screen

opacity:	Lower this number to see through the images and notes more
		200 makes the text crisp but can be hard to see through
		150 is still readable but some backgrounds make it hard
