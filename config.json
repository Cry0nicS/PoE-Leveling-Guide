points:		This is the font size
		I highly recommend leaving this at 9 as the GUI gets too big
		However on large screens you could increase it slightly
		Note that the pictures are hardcode and will not change size

maxNotesWidth:	How many characters should be shown before wrapping text
		The longer this is the larger the Notes GUI will be
		Notes are per zone tips based on text files in the Overlay folder
		Cannot be smaller than 30

maxGuideWidth:	How many characters should be shown before wrapping text
		The longer this is the larger the Guide GUI will be
		The Guid is tips based on notes.txt in each Act folder
		Cannot be smaller than 22

offset:		How much space to leave on the right side of the screen
		1 = All the way to right (covers the map/info)
		This is a good setting if you're going to Alt+F2 and hide the notes
		.855 = As far right as you can go without covering the Mini-Map
		Great setting if you don't use the overlay map
		.8 = Default setting, as far right as you can go without covering anything
		I don't recommend going lower as the UI covers a lot of screen

treeSide:	Which side of the screen to show the passive tree overlay
		The default is the right so it does not interfere with the Health globe
		However, you can change it to left to not block the inventory instead

treeName:	This is the name of file that should be used for the passive tree overlay
		The default is tree.jpg but you can use any valid image file name/type
		Just make sure the file exists in the Overlay/Tree folder

opacity:	Lower this number to see through the images and notes more
		200 makes the text crisp but can be hard to see through
		150 is still readable but some backgrounds make it hard

startHidden:	Should the overlay display on startup
		By default it will so new users see that it is working
		However if you would like it just as a reference you can change this value to 1

displayTimeout: How long in seconds before auto hiding the control bar
		By default it will hide after 10 seconds
		Setting the value to 0 will never hide it

persistText:	Should the Notes and Guide be shown after the timeout
		By default it will hide as well
		However if you want to see it after the timeout change this value to 1
